# LouvainCommunityDetection
A Python implementation of the Louvain Algorithm for Community Detection

The Louvain method is a modularity-based algorithm for community detection in networks. It is a bottom-up hierarchical clustering method that aims to optimize the modularity score. Modularity is a measure of the strength of community structure in a network. It compares the actual number of edges within communities to the expected number in a random network. The algorithm starts by assigning each node to its own community and then iteratively merges communities in a way that maximizes the modularity gain. This process is repeated until no further improvement can be made. The Louvain method uses a greedy optimization strategy, where nodes are iteratively reassigned to the community that yields the highest modularity gain, until a local maximum is reached. The algorithm is efficient and can handle large-scale networks, making it a popular choice for community detection in various fields.
